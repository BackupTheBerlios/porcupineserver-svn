     exception is thrown). Instead, null is returned. 

FIX: The "selected" attribute of an option in a select list was ignored.
FIX: The context menu displayed when you right-click on the desktop task bar
     is updated correctly (Hotfix 20060313).
FIX: The state of the menu options of the context menu inside the

Version 0.0.3
-------------
OPT: QuiX interface images are treated as script modules. They are preloaded and

     This directoty actually contains published directories.
OPT: All scripts, QuiX modules, images and stylesheets are moved inside Porcupine,
     under the "pubdir" directory. This completely separates the connectors files
     from the server files, so that if adding a new QuiX module does not require
     a new release of the web connectors.
