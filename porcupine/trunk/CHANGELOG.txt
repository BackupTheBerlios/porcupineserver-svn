Version 0.0.3
-------------
OPT: QuiX interface images are treated as script modules. They are preloaded and

OPT: "webApps" directory is renamed to "pubdir". The old name was misleading.
     This directoty actually contains published directories.
OPT: All scripts, QuiX modules, images and stylesheets are moved inside Porcupine,
     under the "pubdir" directory. This completely separates the connectors files
     from the server files, so that if adding a new QuiX module does not require
     a new release of the web connectors.
